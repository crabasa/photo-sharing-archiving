# Photo Sharing and Archiving

Some code and scripts to support [my workflow][1] for sharing and archiving my family's photos:

1. Photos are taken on cameras (smart phones and dedicated cameras).
2. Photos can be shared on social services directly from smart phones.
3. Photos are periodically imported to a particular laptop (the family has N laptops).
4. Albums are manually copied to Dropbox. Dropbox is used to organize a **canononical** directory structure of albums.
5. An automated script pushes from Dropbox to S3 for more permanent storage.
6. An automated script pushed from S3 to Glacier for archiving.
